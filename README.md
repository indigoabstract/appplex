# appplex

appplex (or app plex) is a C++ minimal/didactic engine for rapid prototyping of applications/games or some other quick test code.

It's supposed to deal with the problem of accumulating tens or hundreds of tests/prototypes/small apps used for trying out ideas during a programmer's life by having them all in one place :)

Currently, the engine works on Windows and Android (graphics (Opengl ES 2/3), sounds, load files and png images).

# Contact
