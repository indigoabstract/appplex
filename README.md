# app-plex

app-plex is a tool for rapid prototyping any type of applications in C++.
It wants to help you keep all the apps/demos you accumulate in one place and immediately deployable on any supported platform. No more lost or misplaced works!


It includes a minimal 3D engine, OpenGL graphics, playing sounds and loading resources/images.
Atm, it works on Windows and Android.


# Getting Started

I use CMake GUI to build a Visual Studio project out of the source files.

It looks like this:
![CMake params](cmake-ss.png?raw=true "CMake params")

Download CMake here:
https://cmake.org/download/


# Future work:

- Webgl support, to run apps in the browser
- Public apps, so you can share them (with a link), or private apps, to keep them just for yourself.
