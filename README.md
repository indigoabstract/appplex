# appplex

appplex (or app plex) is a C++ minimal/didactic engine for rapid prototyping of applications/games or some other quick test code.
It's supposed to deal with the problem of accumulating tens or hundreds of tests/prototypes/small apps used for trying out ideas during a programmer's life :)

It currently works on Windows and Android (graphics, using OpenGL (ES 2/3), sounds, load files, png images).
